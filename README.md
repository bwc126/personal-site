## A Personal Showcase for Brian W Coe

This project began as an exercise in learning basic HTML and CSS, while making something worth showing to other learners and those interested in seeing a progression of prior work. It was the Front End Nanodegree project 1, in Q3/4 of 2015.

A few months after the Udacity FEND project was successfully submitted, this site became the nucleus of my personal website. I gave it a slick, dark neon aesthetic while otherwise maintaining the minimalistic feel of the original, making a few other changes as well.

Since finishing the core projects of the FEND in early Q2 of 2016, I've found the need to have an-up-to-date and comprehensive showcase of my talents. This is also in the interest of completing the career counseling portion of the FEND, and graduating the nanodegree.

### To Run

Open index.html in something later than IE8 (and hopefully not IE).
