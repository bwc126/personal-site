## A Personal Showcase for Brian W Coe

This project began as an exercise in learning basic HTML and CSS, while making something worth showing to other learners and those interested in seeing a progression of prior work. It was the Front End Nanodegree project 1, in Q3/4 of 2015.

A few months after the Udacity FEND project was successfully submitted, this site became the nucleus of my personal website. I gave it a slick, dark neon aesthetic while otherwise maintaining the minimalistic feel of the original, making a few other changes as well.

Since finishing the core projects of the FEND in early Q2 of 2016, I've found the need to have an-up-to-date and comprehensive showcase of my talents. This is also in the interest of completing the career counseling portion of the FEND, and graduating the nanodegree.

### To Run

Open index.html in something later than IE8 (and hopefully not IE).

## Key Features

### The spotlight

Spotlight changes when the mouse enters an image for one of the projects on the page. This area also uses lower resolution images when loaded on a smaller viewport.

### The subject areas

Programming, Engineering and Science. Key projects/points of interest from each area are detailed via a modal, with a thumbnail and larger images for each.

#### Style Guide

# ToDo:

- Links to running projects or interactive overviews. (Use a gh-pages branch on each repo with a project to be linked-to)

- ~~Add contact me buttons: linkedIn, Gmail, G+, Github, Udacity, etc.~~

- Add resumes to the 'about me' modal, replace google plus with a resume.

- Populate content areas.

- Optimize image/file loading, perhaps using a preloader service.

- Make optimal use of images for responsive design.

- Minimize number of CSS rules and classes.

- Change URL to something simple.

- Use something besides hr tags to visually differentiate menu items.

- Use parallax.(?)

- Use accordion menu for each project, eliminate modals and jumbotron, replace with a carousel at the top or within each project for multiple images. Alternately, an accordion menu entry with each subject area, and the carousel within each accordion changes for viewing each project within the subject area, changing the text along with the image.

- Refactor 'app' into views, models, controllers.
